<p>SImple you would think but there are a few steps more than what you may first think to getting SSO through Windows Azure Active Directory working.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Next you need to install Active Directory Federated Services.&nbsp; You do this through Server Manager-&gt;Roles on your WSE box.&nbsp; The go to the flag in Server Manager and select the post deployment details.&nbsp; Follow the wizard creating new managed service user and creating the KDS root key as instructed.</p>
<p>Install the Windows Azure Active Directory Module.&nbsp; You will also need the Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant for IT Professionals BETA module too.&nbsp; Install .net 3.5 through roles and features.</p>
<p>In my case I had an already confirmed domain but I needed to convert this to Federated for SSO.&nbsp; Use Connect-MsolService with the organizational account for your domain and then the Convert-MsolDomainToFederated –DominaName “domain.tld” </p>
<p>In Windows Azure you should confirm that the domain name is now marked as verified and is configured for SSO.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Log off and log back on again – actually I did a restart to install updates.</p>
<p>Then download dirsync and install on your local WSE.</p>

<p>After running it you should all be in sync.&nbsp; If you change identities used for the sync then you’ll need to run the tool again.</p>
