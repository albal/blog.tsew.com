<p><img alt="Crashplan_logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/crashplan_logo.png" width="185" height="97" border="0" />CrashPlan is brilliant. Don't let me tell you though. <a title="Bing! it and decide." href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=crashplan" target="_blank">Bing! it and decide</a>. Anyway you will find it you have to back up a large number of files, say in the region of 200,000 then you will need some more memory assigned to the Java Virtual Machine that runs CrashPlan. I am talking about windows here and this is the info I got back from support. You may find this useful if after a while CrashPlan seems to bomb out or keep on preserving with something and not really getting anywhere, i.e. constant file analysis or so on.</p>
<p><strong>Here is the info</strong>:</p>
<p>Running Notepad or any other text-editor as an Admin, edit the CrashPlan engine's CrashPlanService.ini file to allow it to use more java memory:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop the backup engine: http://support.crashplan.com/doku.php/how_to/stop_and_start_engine</li>
<li>Locate the Notepad program, right-click and Launch as Administrator</li>
<li>Go to File &gt; Open, and navigate to C:\Program Files\CrashPlan\CrashPlanService.ini</li>
<li>Find the following line in the file: -Xmx512m</li>
<li>Edit to something larger such as 640, 768, 896, or 1024. E.g.: -Xmx1024m</li>
<li>Start the backup engine.</li>
</ol>
<p>This sets the maximum amount of memory that CrashPlan can use. CrashPlan will not use that much until it needs it. I would recommend starting out setting it to 768, and go higher only if you continue experiencing problems. You can set it as high as 2048 on 32-bit systems, or even higher on 64-bit systems.</p>
