<p>If you played the Window Server Launch sweepstakes game you may be having trouble finding out who won. My final position was something like 160th, so I think I was in with a 1:50 chance of winning.&nbsp; Not too bad.&nbsp; Though because I’ve still not heard anything yet, and that it’s been 2 weeks since the game has finished, I don’t think I have won.</p>
<h3>HOW CAN YOU FIND OUT WHO WON?</h3>
<p>To request a list of winners who received a prize worth $25.00 or more, send email with the subject line “Windows Server 2012 Virtual Launch Winners” to <a href="mailto:launch12@microsoft.com?Subject=Windows%20Server%202012%20Virtual%20Launch%20Winners">launch12@microsoft.com</a> by October 30, 2012.</p>
<h3>WHO IS SPONSORING THIS SWEEPSTAKES?</h3>
