excerpt: "What is Time Traveler?\n\nTime Traveler for Windows Home Server when installed
  allows you to revert to any version of a file stored on your Windows Home Server.
  For example you might realise that the section of a report you deleted a few revisions
  ago actually is now needed. Time Traveler will enable you to go through previous
  versions of the file and you can then copy out the text that is needed. While Time
  Traveler is installed you can be safe in the knowledge that your files are protected
  from being overwritten. This is especially useful in server environment where many
  users may have access to the same files.\n\nWhere can I get it?\n\nTime Traveler
  can be found at http://www.timetravelerwhs.com/index.html and though not free like
  some add-ins the amount of protection it offers is very good for the fee of $29.99
  (Â£19.54). There is a trial version available and once downloaded to the Add-Ins
  folder of your Software Network Share installation is as straightforward as any
  other standard Add-In. Note: Power Pack 2 must be installed for Time Server to work
  â\x80\x93 though by now you should consider upgrading to Power Pack 3.\n\nWalkthrough\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen
  the Windows Home Server Console, click on Settings in the top right, select the
  Add-Ins option and then the Available tab. Click Install on the Time Traveler for
  Windows Home Server item.\n\n\n\nOnce you click Ok after the installation has completed
  the Windows Home Server Console will close as normal and should reopen. When the
  Console comes back up you should notice a new tab item for Time Traveler at the
  top of the Console. Selecting this will bring up the option to register or continue
  in Trial Mode.\n\n\n\nFirst time in and you have to go through the setup wizard.
  If you click Cancel you have to close the Windows Home Server Console and reopen
  it to get back to this step.\n\n\n\nClick OK to acknowledge completion of the setup
  of the internal database and initialisation of files used by Time Traveler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow
  you are ready to select which folders you want to enable to be protected by Time
  Traveler. \n\n\n\nHere I have selected the Public folder to be enabled for protection
  and for the purposes of demonstration Iâ\x80\x99ve set the Rollback Creation Interval
  to 1 minute. On a live system you might want to consider having rollback intervals
  of a day or 12 hours. Note that the Rollback Interval applies to all folders enabled
  for Rollback and if you are monitoring folders with many files that change often
  you could find your server under some load.\n\nIâ\x80\x99ve already created a document
  in this folder with 10 paragraphs. Iâ\x80\x99ve opened it and replaced all the text
  with â\x80\x9CItâ\x80\x99s Goneâ\x80\x9D. I can then go back and view the Time Traveler
  tab and monitor what happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see the total rollbacks has
  increased and the time of the last roll back indicates when my save was made. To
  get back to my old version of the file you simply right click on share where the
  file resides and select Rollback\n\n\n\nThis is the tricky part in working out when
  your file was changed and selecting a time before that. Looking at my share I can
  see the file save was made at 14:01 so if I rollback to all the files and their
  state at 14:00 on my Public Share then I should be able to get back to my document
  with 10 Paragraphs in.\n\nBelow is my document as of 14:02\n\n\n\nAfter selecting
  Rollback in the Window Home Server Console a dialog appears allowing you to set
  the time and also if you want to rollback a share, folder within a share of a file
  anywhere within a share that has Rollback enabled. Iâ\x80\x99ve selected my file
  to be rolled back to what it was at 14:00.\n\n\n\nHit the Rollback button to recover
  your file and then browse to the share location provided in the next dialog box.\n\n\n\nTime
  Traveler organises recovered files according to the share they have been recovered
  from and the time of the snapshot and their location. So in this case our files
  can be found at \\\\\\Time Traveler Rollbacks\\Public\\2009-12-09 [14-00-00] \n\n\n\nOne
  thing to remember is that by default Time Traveler does not enable any user to have
  read or write access to the Rollbacks folder and you may want to enable this if
  you want to access files that you rollback from other machines on your network.
  All in all Time Traveler is a useful addition to you software add-ins especially
  if you use your network shares for documents shared between users. Itâ\x80\x99s
  one of those add-ins that is invaluable when something inevitably goes wrong."
