<p>I'm pleased to say some way has been made on getting a beta version of my Anti-Virus Add-In for Windows Home Server based on ClamWin. Go check on the SourceForge site at <a href="http://whsclamav.sourceforge.net/">http://whsclamav.sourceforge.net/</a>  to Download WHSClamAV and leave feedback or suggestions.</p>
