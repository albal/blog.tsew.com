<p>Logon to your ESX host and run the following command to map a physical disk to a rdm file in the folder where you VM is located:</p>
<pre class="">vmkfstools -r /vmfs/devices/disks/naa.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX   rdm1.vmdk</pre>
<p>Edit your VMX file to point to the newly created RDM disk:</p>
<pre>scsi0:2.present = "TRUE"
scsi0:2.deviceType = "scsi-hardDisk"
scsi0:2.fileName = "rdm1.vmdk"
scsi0:2.mode = "independent-persistent"
scsi0:2.redo = ""</pre>
