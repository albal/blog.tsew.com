<p>I used the BT line checker and got the magically line FTTPoD showing as enabled for my cabinet. However I can't find anyone who will supply me with this service:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1141" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/fttpod.png" alt="FTTPoD" width="651" height="303" /></p>
<p>Maybe I will just have to wait for Infinity 3/4 to be available - I wonder how long that takes.</p>
