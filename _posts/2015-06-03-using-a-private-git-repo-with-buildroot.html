<p>Buildroot is pure awesomeness for maintaining the build of a GNU/Linux based operating system.&nbsp; However, during my ventures I’ve had to keep private code private so use a git repo behind ssh.&nbsp; There is a way to achieve this with Buildroot but it is undocumented:</p>
<blockquote><p>LIBFOO_SITE_METHOD = git<br />LIBFOO_SITE = ssh://git@server.domain.tld/group/repo.git<br />LIBFOO_VERSION = v1.01.a</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the first line we have to set the method to git as the auto detect won’t work on SSH<br />The second line contains the git repo as it would be defined if using git via ssh accept prepended with ssh:// and the the colon that is normally between the end of the FQDN and the location is replaced with a slash.<br />Line 3 can be a tag, branch or commit hash.</p>
<p>I am not sure if line 2 is correct in all cases but it works for me.</p>
