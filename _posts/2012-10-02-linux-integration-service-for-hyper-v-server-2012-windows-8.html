<p><a href="http://albal21.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/mslis.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-817" title="Linux Integration Services 3.4" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mslis.png" alt="" width="410" height="184" /></a>It's not so easy to find but Microsoft have released the Linux Integration Services ISO for Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8. It also supports older instances of Hyper-V</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34603</p>
<p>•Driver support: Linux Integration Services supports the network controller and the IDE and SCSI storage controllers that were developed specifically for Hyper-V.</p>
<p>•Fastpath Boot Support for Hyper-V: Boot devices now take advantage of the block Virtualization Service Client (VSC) to provide enhanced performance.</p>
<p>•Time Keeping: The clock inside the virtual machine will remain accurate by synchronizing to the clock on the virtualization server via Timesync service, and with the help of the pluggable time source device.</p>
<p>•Integrated Shutdown: Virtual machines running Linux can be shut down from either Hyper-V Manager or System Center Virtual Machine Manager by using the “Shut down” command.</p>
<p>•Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) Support: Supported Linux distributions can use multiple virtual processors per virtual machine. The actual number of virtual processors that can be allocated to a virtual machine is only limited by the underlying hypervisor.</p>
<p>•Heartbeat: This feature allows the virtualization server to detect whether the virtual machine is running and responsive.</p>
<p>•KVP (Key Value Pair) Exchange: Information about the running Linux virtual machine can be obtained by using the Key Value Pair exchange functionality on the Windows Server 2008 virtualization server.</p>
<p>•Integrated Mouse Support: Linux Integration Services provides full mouse support for Linux guest virtual machines.</p>
<p>•Live Migration: Linux virtual machines can undergo live migration for load balancing purposes.</p>
<p>•Jumbo Frames: Linux virtual machines can be configured to use Ethernet frames with more than 1500 bytes of payload.</p>
<p>•VLAN tagging and trunking: Administrators can attach single or multiple VLAN ids to synthetic network adapters.</p>
<p>System requirements</p>
<p>Supported operating systems: Windows 8 Pro, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows Server 2012</p>
