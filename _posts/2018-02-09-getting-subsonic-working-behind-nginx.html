<p>The subsonic Web UI uses frames as if you just proxy subsonic with SSL/TLS termination like you would with any other website you will find the pages does not load. You need to add a directive to your configuration:</p>
<p><code>add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;<br />
</code><br />
This should also work with madsonic.</p>
