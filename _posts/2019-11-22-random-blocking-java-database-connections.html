<p>So I came across a problem with a Java App not being able to open a connection to an Oracle Database.  It wasn't a problem with Credentials or the SID but a failure to connect.  After a bit of digging I found that there wasn't enough entropy in the system to get the required amount of bytes from /dev/random - the solution is to edit java.security to use /dev/urandom instead:</p>
